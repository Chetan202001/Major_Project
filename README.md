# Major_Project
Final Year Project
 
 
 
 Overview
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on audio data using the TextBlob library. Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the sentiment or emotional tone behind a piece of text. In this case, we convert audio data into text and then analyze the sentiment of that text using the TextBlob library.

Dependencies
To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

Python (3.6 or higher)
TextBlob (0.15.3 or higher)
SpeechRecognition (3.8.1 or higher)
PyAudio (0.2.11 or higher)
You can install the required dependencies using pip by running the following command:

pip install textblob SpeechRecognition PyAudio


Please note that PyAudio may require additional system-level dependencies to be installed. You can refer to the PyAudio documentation for more information on installation instructions specific to your operating system.

Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code files.
Make sure you have installed all the required dependencies mentioned above.
Place the audio file you want to analyze in the project directory.
Update the audio_file variable in the sentiment_analysis.py script with the path to your audio file.
Run the sentiment_analysis.py script using the following command:

python sentiment_analysis.py


The script will convert the audio file into text using the SpeechRecognition library and then perform sentiment analysis on that text using TextBlob.
The sentiment analysis results will be displayed on the console, showing the polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) and subjectivity (objective or subjective) of the text.
Limitations
The accuracy of the sentiment analysis depends on the accuracy of the speech-to-text conversion. Errors in the conversion may affect the sentiment analysis results.
This project uses the default sentiment analysis model provided by TextBlob, which may not be suitable for all types of text data. You may need to fine-tune or train a custom sentiment analysis model depending on your specific requirements.
The performance of the sentiment analysis may vary depending on the audio quality and the clarity of speech in the audio file.
